## Usage

When you open the Work Day Scheduler, you will find the current date and rows of time blocks from 9AM-5PM, with save buttons on the side.


The colors of the time blocks show you which events are in the past: grey, present: red, and future: green.


In those you can also enter your events or appointments for each time block.


Once you entered you event Description, you can press on the save Button on the right of the time block, which saves the event.



On the top, you will see a message displayed, which confirms that the entered event was saved in the localStorage.


That's all! Now you can comfortably schedule your work day!
